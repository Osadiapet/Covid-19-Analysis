The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and has been a major public health concern since its outbreak. In this project, we aim to analyze the COVID-19 dataset provided by WHO to gain insights into the spread of the disease across different regions and countries. The dataset contains information on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as the date and country/region of reporting.
